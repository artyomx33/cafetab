# Luna + Claude Collaboration Guidelines

## The Process
When working together on features, follow this exchange pattern:

1. **Discuss First** (2-3 exchanges)
   - Share the problem/feature request
   - Luna proposes approach + rationale
   - Claude validates feasibility + suggests refinements
   - Agree on final approach before coding

2. **Questions Always Go Through Each Other**
   - Don't assume - ask Luna for UX guidance
   - Don't guess - ask Claude for technical constraints
   - Better alignment = better outcomes

3. **Review After Implementation**
   - Screenshot/demo the result
   - Luna reviews against original intent
   - Iterate if needed

## Luna's Role (ChatGPT)
- Logic guardian + product sharpener
- UX decisions and user flow
- Prioritization (what ships first)
- "Brutal verdicts" on what matters

## Claude's Role (Claude Code)
- Technical implementation
- Feasibility checks
- Code architecture decisions
- Performance considerations

## Key Learnings
- Table Pulse Rings: Status derived from data, not stored
- Payment UX: "Moment of Truth" - where apps win/lose
- Visual Menu: Category colors reduce cognitive load
- Speed Strip: 80/20 rule - common items need fast access
- ETA Chips: Confidence without complexity
